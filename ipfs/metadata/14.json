    "description": "A Rune sacred to Frey, Summer sun and the erect penis. Right Side: This is a rune of travel and change, possibly of job, career, residence or maybe all three. This rune brings a message from the Gods and rank, pride, happiness and an aid to the restless. It may also indicate spiritual journeys and faith in one's destiny. Reversed: This rune reversed warns of a restlessness and a desire to escape by travelling or moving away from the problem - a passage away from pain.",
