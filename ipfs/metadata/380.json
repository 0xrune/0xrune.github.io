    "description": "A Rune sacred to intensity, it intensifies any other rune associated with it. Right Side: The rune of obstacles and mental blocks. It is a barrier stopping or preventing, while warning against proceeding. As a beacon it is a 'shining light', but stillness, patience and sacrifice of the 'I' may win the prize. Other meanings include: coldness between people, lethargy, death end, termination, strong hidden forces and blocks to thought and deed. This rune intensifies the meaning of any other runes associated with it. Reversed: This rune reversed is indicative of a coldness which gives rise to conflict and arguments. only by acting positively can the ice be melted.",
