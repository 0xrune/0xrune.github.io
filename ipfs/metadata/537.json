    "description": "A Rune sacred to Freya and Frey the bountiful couple. Right Side: The rune of harvest, fertility and the turning wheel. This rune is symbolic of success, an abundant year and the cycles of nature and life. Projects will succeed although plans cannot be rushed, and patience must be observed. Effort reaps its reward. Other meanings include: the sacred marriage between heaven and earth, thriving crops, generosity of kings and prosperity. 'When the harvest comes - celebrate!'. Reversed: This rune reversed symbolizes a block in nature. Matters come to a head.",
