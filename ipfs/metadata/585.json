    "description": "A Rune sacred to Heimdall, the watcher. Right Side: This is a rune of harmonious unexpected success. It is a balance between light and darkness; as night gives way to dawn, this gives way to day and so on. It is a beacon of light bringing forth clarity, success and abundance in life. The time is right to embark upon a new project but be cautious in the journey forward. Reversed: This rune reversed warns of treading carefully and conserving energy.",
