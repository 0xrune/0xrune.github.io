    "description": "A Rune sacred to Thor, God of thunder and strength. Right Side: A rune of creativity and sexual energy. UR also represents the death of a cycle, out with the old wild ox and in with the new. May indicate a dark period with material loss or the loss of a person but new opportunities will arise from this. It is indicative of an unpredictable power, tests and greed. Opportunities, sexuality and good luck are the keywords for this rune. Reversed: Opportunities that have passed by possible health problems and a lack of progress in certain areas.",
