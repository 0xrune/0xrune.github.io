It can indicate the start of something special and to facilitate this, doubts must be cleansed before moving forward. Other meanings include: fertility in the bodily sense, beauty and the breasts of the Earth Goddess. Reversed: This rune reversed is symbolic of hurdles or problems getting in the way of the birth or start of something. This rune reversed warns of stagnation.",
