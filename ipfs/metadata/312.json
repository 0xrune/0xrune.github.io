    "description": "A Rune of a sacred mark dedicated to the Gods. Right Side: A rune of generosity and the giving and receiving of gifts; and with the help of the Gods, kindness and aid to others. It is a gift and a greeting of peace. Partnerships and relationships are blessed. People unite and relationships move to a deeper level. 'The lovers kiss; the bountiful Goddess abundance.' This rune also represents sacrifice and the balance of opposing factions or elements. A remnant of Gyfu gis still sent today to mark the passing of another year. Reversed: This rune reversed is indicative of harm to friendship, separations and self-centered behavior.",
