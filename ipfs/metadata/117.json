    "description": "A Rune sacred to Frigg, the 'All Mother'. Right Side: This is a rune of mystery and things not being quite what they seem. It is a time to experience the unexpected and live for the now. Other meanings include: womb, female fertility. A game that is played between 'desire and destiny'. A rune of revelation. Reversed: This rune reversed is symbolic of hidden things that are revealed and cast out into the open.",
