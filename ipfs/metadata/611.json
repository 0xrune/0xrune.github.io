    "description": "A Rune sacred to Thor and thunder. Right Side: A rune of personal development and transformation. This rune is indicative of journeys and travel. The journeys may be of a physical or spiritual nature, but either way will bring about some positive developments. It is also a time of choice and of making the right move to ensure all effort and energy is channeled in the right direction. Reversed: This rune reversed is indicative of delays and possibly difficult journeys. It can also mean that there are important lessons that need to be learned.",
