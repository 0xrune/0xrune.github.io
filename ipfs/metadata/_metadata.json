As Thor was the Norse God of strength other key meanings of this rune are security, protection and possibly good news. Reversed: Thorn (th) as a thorn bush can indicate dangers of a smaller less significant kind. However, reversed this rune can indicate unfavorable news or a sense of feeling vulnerable.",
